The descent of Maori is traced from the gods, to their ancestors from Hawaiki who sailed canoes across the Paci ﬁ c Ocean and then down to their present tribal groupings in Aotearoa. Tribal lands and kinship links are still key factors that bind Maori society. 5.

If a farmer grows the same plant over and over in the same place, the soil will lose its ability to feed the plant. The farmer must add fertilizer to help the soil. Organic farmers do not add fertilizer. They will rotate crops or use animal manure and plant compost to make the soil rich again. Compost is made from plant material that has broken down into soil. It has all the food a plant needs to grow. Pesticides are also avoided. These are chemicals that kill pests like bad insects or animals.

Organic farmers have other ways to deal with pests be- cause pesticides kill good animals and insects that protect the plants. Foxes and snakes eat the mice. Some insects like ladybirds eat the bad insects. And of course there are weeds. These are the plants that farmers do not want be- cause they steal growing space from the good plants. To stop weeds, organic farmers can scrape the soil several times. Eventually, the weeds will die. Organic farming usually needs a lot of human labour to do the job of chemicals.

Products should be designed so that when they no longer work, they are easy to recycle. The recycling process itself is also being made more effective.

Oxygen produced by plants is released into the air. Plants use light to make their own food. During the process, they take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. The process is called photosynthesis. Teacher: Do you know all living things need food for energy and growth? Student A: Yes, I do. Plants make their own food but animals can’t. Animals have to get their food from elsewhere. Teacher: Plants serve as food for most animals, even if animals don’t eat plants directly. For example, a worm eats leaves and other bits of plants; the worm is eaten by a bird and the bird is eaten by a cat. Although the cat and the bird don’t eat the plants themselves, they still depend on them to survive. What is this called? Student B: This is called a food chain. The food chain shows how",

A tree is a tall plant with a single stem of wood — the trunk. Smaller branches grow out from the trunk, and the leaves (usually green) grow on these branches. When trees grow close together, their trunks are longer and straighter. On the outside of the trunk and branches of the tree, you can see the bark. Like the skin on your body, this bark protects the tree. The bark at the bottom of the trunk is old, and therefore it is rough and cracked. The bark near the top of the tree is younger and smoother. When you look at a tree, you see only half of it, because the other half is under the ground — the roots. The roots are a very important part of the tree. They help it to grow. Many people think the roots of a tree grow downwards, but in fact most of a tree’s roots grow outwards — and they can",

Many people think the roots of a tree grow downwards, but in fact most of a tree’s roots grow outwards — and they can push outwards through the thick earth as far as the tree is high. The roots take water and minerals from the earth up into the trunk and the branches. A tree can live longer than all other living things. In fact, some trees can live for hundreds — even thousands — of years! The oldest trees in the world today are in California, USA. But how does a tree grow so big and live for such a long time? A tree needs sunlight and water to grow. High above the ground, the tree’s leaves use energy from the sun to make food. The green colour in the leaves is called “chlorophyll.” Below the ground, the roots of the tree move out to get water. The main roots are quite thick and strong, and from these main roots, many small roots (called rootlets) grow. If you look carefully at these rootlets, you",

Like all traps, the Venus ﬂ ytrap uses a special bait. This means it has something that will attract or invite the insects to come near. The Venus ﬂ ytrap has a very sweet, sugary liquid on its leaves. The insects can smell this, and they think it is deli- cious — this is the bait.

And the plant will store the glu- cose as starch once it has been made. We can test whether a leaf has photo- synthesized or not by testing it for starch. (1) Dip a leaf in boiling water for about a minute to soften it. (2) Put the leaf in a test tube of ethanol and stand the test tube in hot water for ten minutes. (This removes the colour.) (3) Remove and wash the leaf. (4) Lay the leaf ﬂ at in a petri dish and add iodine. (5) If starch is present, the leaf should go blue/black.

From the time children can ﬁ rst toddle after their mothers, helping to pull weeds and plant seeds, gardening can be exciting and interesting for them all their lives. Gardening makes a person appreciate beauty, and gives him / her a realization that plants, like all other living things, will be well and healthy only if they are given good care, proper food, and enough water and sunshine. Anyone who plants a gar- den must “follow through” if he wants success. A week’s neglect of weed pulling or of watering in a dry spell may result in a ruined garden.

They want to understand nature, and ﬁ nd out how science and technology affect wildlife. One of the most complicated types of science is ecology. Ecologists try to un- derstand how the natural world links together. They study how animals and plants live, what animals eat, and why plants grow better in some soils than in others. They count the numbers of animals and plants, and may trap animals briefly to study them, or follow the growth of trees in a wood. When the balance of nature is dam- aged, ecologists can help to ﬁ nd out why. 7 7 Culture Corner Culture Corner 8 8 Game Zone Game Zone 1 A game: Three in a Row. Divide students into groups of 4.

A: How do you ﬁ nd the opera today, Mr Taylor? B: Absolutely good. I adore Beijing opera. I wonder when Beijing opera came into being. A: Beijing opera dates back to the year 1790. That year, four local opera troupes of Anhui Province came to Beijing on a performance tour for Em- peror Qianlong. The tour was quite a hit and the troupes stayed. The art- ists picked out the tunes of the Hubei local opera, combined them with the best of several other local operas and created a new opera—Beijing opera. B: I see. But what are so-called “Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou”? A: “Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou” are just terms for four different types of roles. “Sheng” is a positive male role, “Dan” is a positive female role, “Jing” is a supporting male role with a striking character and “Chou” is the clown.

A: The facial make-up is painted like masks; different colours of faces repre- sent different characters. For example, yellow and white represent cunning, (220–280). He is well-known for his faithfulness to his Emperor, Liu Bei. The reddish purple face likewise shows a just and noble character — Lian Po, for instance. In the well-known play Jiang Xiang He , General Lian was proud and he quarrelled with the chief minister to whom he was ﬁ nally reconciled. The black face indicates a rough and bold character. A good example is Bao Gong, a fearless and impartial judge of the Song Dynasty. White is for a trickster. A typical character is Cao Cao, a powerful and cruel prime",

But if music and acting are something you love, I’m sure you are already into musicals and have seen several. Musicals have always been a very important part of human culture, so they are still a beautiful and important part of life today. The three main components of a musical are the music, the lyrics, and the book. The most famous musicals in the world are The Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Les Misérables, A Chorus Line and The Sound of Music . Because of their long runs on Broadway, most of them are still being performed today. The lengths of most musicals are from one and a half hours to three hours. Musicals today are typically presented in two acts, with one intermis- sion of ten to twenty minutes. Appreciating musicals is often something that takes time. Beginners should learn",

Beginners should learn the musical’s story before going to see the performance live. The reason for this is that many musicals might seem disjointed or confusing if someone does not know the story beforehand. A musical often opens with a song that sets the tone of the show, introduc- es some or all of the major characters, and shows the setting of the play. Music provides a means of expressing emotion. However, typically, fewer words are sung in a ﬁ ve-minute song than are spoken in a ﬁ ve-minute dialogue.

The arts of paint- ing, poetry and calligraphy were called the “Three Perfections.” All the three arts use a brush, so they are often combined in one piece of art. The ancient Chinese were also famous for porcelain making. Porcelain is thin china made from clay. For hundreds of years, the Chinese kept how to make porce- lain a secret. Today, many factories make porcelain plates and other objects to sell throughout the world. Today the arts are still popular in China. Two of the most popular art forms are acrobatics and Beijing opera. Opera often tells of famous events. In Beijing opera, the performers wear fancy costumes and their faces are painted like masks.
