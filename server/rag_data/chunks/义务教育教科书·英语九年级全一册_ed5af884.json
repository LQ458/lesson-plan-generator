When my mum wants me to go to the dentist, I always refuse. This morning, I woke up with a terrible toothache. I told my mum about it. She thought that one of my teeth was probably rotten and that I needed to go to a dentist. I had no choice but to go with her. When we got to the dentist’s office, there were strange smells, strange sounds and people dressed in strange clothing. Imagine how scared I was! My hands were shaking. My legs felt so heavy, and it was difficult to stand! Fortunately, the dentist, Dr. Hu, was very kind. She saw right away that I was scared and told me not to worry.

My mother brought me some new books to read (but no homework). I also have a television in my room! I will write to you again soon.

T H I N K A B O U T I T A scientist in China had a dream when he was a child. In the dream, he grew a new type of rice that was as big as a peanut. The plant allowed farmers to rest in its shade. That child was Yuan Longping. Yuan grew up and became the “Father of Hybrid Rice”. In the 1960s, a few years after he finished his studies in agriculture at university, he came up with an idea for hybrid rice. Since then, he has spent much of his time researching and developing new varieties. In 1973, together with other scientists, he succeeded in developing hybrid rice. The introduction of this new product made China a leader in rice production. For this, he became known as the “Father of Hybrid Rice”.

Helen Keller was a model for people around the world. Helen was born in 1880 in the United States. When she was nineteen months old, Helen fell ill. She had a high fever that made her blind and deaf. Before her illness, Helen was a bright and happy girl. After she lost her ability to see and hear, she became difficult and wild. She often shouted and cried. In 1887, a young teacher named Anne Sullivan, began to help Helen. She spelled words on Helen’s hand with her fingers. At first, the words didn’t mean anything to Helen. Then, one day, while Helen was playing in some water, Anne spelled W-A-T-E-R on Helen’s hand. Suddenly, Helen understood. That day, she learned",

She had special books with letters that she could feel with her fingers. She also learned to write and even speak. When Helen studied at university, Anne sat beside her. She listened to the professors’ words and spelled them on Helen’s hand. After Helen finished university, she visited many countries. She spoke about her life. She was very famous for her courage and hard work. She did her best to help others in the community who were deaf or blind. She tried to live her life without any regret. She will be greatly missed.",

He was a famous doctor and a nice man. In 1916, Norman Bethune graduated from the University of Toronto. With a lot of hard work, he found new ways to help people with T.B. — a disease that damages the lungs. He also invented tools that remain in use today. Norman Bethune is well known for helping the Chinese people in the Anti-Japanese War. In 1938, he made a decision to go to northern China because he knew many people were dying in the war.

When she first began working, few North American women had jobs, as most people thought women should stay at home. But Bourke-White had a job, and it was a dangerous job. In her mind, it didn’t matter. She said, “If you banish fear, nothing terribly bad can happen to you.” Bourke-White took many famous pictures of important people and events in the twentieth century.

The accident happened at about 7:30 a.m. She and her brother, James, were on their way to an early basketball practice. “We were in a hurry,” James told the reporter. “We didn’t want to be late for practice. Ann dropped her basketball, and it rolled onto the street. She raced to get it.” Northern News, December 7 Girl, 13, Hit by Car Mrs. Andrews, who was walking several steps behind the two students, saw it happen. “I don’t know whose fault it was,” Mrs. Andrews said. “The girl didn’t see the car.

My head hit the ground. I lay there for a few minutes. I tried to get up, but I couldn’t! “There’s something wrong with me,” I thought. I felt so terrible that I lay down again. Then I saw blood on my shoe. My hand and knee were bleeding. As I lay there, I took off my helmet. There was a sharp rock sticking out of it. It was pretty scary to look at. Thank goodness I wore my helmet! I shouted for help. A stranger stopped his truck and came to help me. He put my bike in the back of his truck and drove me to the hospital.

But I’ll never be careless again! My bicycle helmet saved my life! Dig In Cycling is fun. But before getting on a bicycle, you should double check the following things: 1. You have a helmet. A helmet protects your head, which can get hurt in a bicycle accident. My name is Jackie. I like cycling. 2. The brakes work OK. No brakes, no cycling. 3. The light is still working. Being able to see is really important at night. 4. The tyres are neither too full nor too flat. This will ensure that you have a pleasant trip.",

T H I N K A B O U T I T Earthquakes usually come without warning. What should you do if this happens to you? Stay calm as the earth begins to shake and move. An earthquake is dangerous, but there are things you can do to protect yourself. If you are inside when the earthquake starts, get under a table or a bed. You need to have something strong around you to protect you from falling objects. Do not stand near walls or windows and stay out of the kitchen. The kitchen is dangerous because there are so many glass objects. Also, never get into a lift during an earthquake. If you are outside, get to an open area as fast as you can.

When the earthquake is over, there is still plenty of danger. If you see a fire, quickly move outdoors to an open area. Keep an eye out for things that can fall o n you. If you have a phone, use it only once to call your family or a friend. Too many calls will bring down the phone system. Your chances of survival in an earthquake go up if you stay calm. Staying calm is not easy, but it can save your life. Earthquakes are terrible. Learning Tip An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the ground. It happens because there is movement in the earth’s crust.",

T H I N K A B O U T I T Dear Brian, I got your e-mail. I like your new rule. I will never try to catch a falling dinosaur. It isn’t safe! Danny also wrote to me about the accident. He felt bad because he was careless. You advised him to use a ladder, but he didn’t listen. He was lucky you were there to catch him. But I guess you weren’t so lucky. Accidents happen so suddenly. I remember when I was seven years old, my mother took me to the park one day. I saw a big tree. My mother tried to stop me, but I really wanted to climb the tree. I told her I would be careful. “Don’t climb too high,” she warned. She watched me climb higher and higher. “Look at me, Mother!” I shouted. “I can almost touch the sky!” “That’s too high,” she called. “Be careful, Li Ming!” Suddenly, the branch broke. I fell.

Every story must have a beginning, a middle and an end. It takes too much time to write a story. Jenny: That’s true. But a story doesn’t limit you like a poem does. With poems, you need to think about format, rhyme and meaning. You must use words very carefully because so few words are used in poems.

Long ago, there was a good and honest woodcutter. One day, when he was cutting wood beside a lake, he lost his axe in the water. The water was deep, and he could not get his axe back. He had only one axe, and he needed it to make his living. He sat down and began to cry. As he cried, a spirit appeared. She asked the man what was wrong. She listened to the woodcutter and felt sorry for him. But what could she do to help? Suddenly she came up with a great idea. The spirit dove into the lake and brought back a gold axe. “Is this the axe you lost?” asked the good spirit. The man looked at the gold axe, knowing it wasn’t his. Because he was honest, he admitted to the spirit that it wasn’t his axe. Learning Tip This story is adapted from a European fable. A fable is a fictional story about",

Every afternoon, children would play in the garden after school. They ran in the grass and climbed the trees. They loved to listen to the singing of the birds. How happy they were! One day the children were playing in the garden when a giant appeared. “What are you doing here?” the giant cried in a loud voice. “This is my garden! You must leave immediately!” The children were frightened. They ran away and dared not come back. The next day, the giant built a high wall around his garden and put a notice on a board: DO NOT ENTER! The poor children no longer had a place to play.

The green grass was covered with snow, and the cold winds kept the birds away. “I don’t understand why spring is so late coming to my garden this year,” said the giant. He felt sad as he looked through the window at his frozen, white garden. One morning as the giant was lying awake in his bed, he heard lovely music coming through the window. He thought it must be the king’s musicians passing by. “Perhaps spring has come at last,” he said as he jumped out of his bed and looked outside. What did the giant see?

Jenny thinks stories are easier to write than poems, but I don’t think so. At the beginning, I was afraid to try writing a poem. I tried to write one about my favourite place beside a lake. But it was too hard to write that poem! Then my teacher encouraged me to write a humorous poem because I am always saying funny things. So I wrote a funny poem about a donut.

Did your mother ever sing a song to you as she tried to get you to sleep? In fact, songs are just poems set to music. They combine the wonderful words of poems with the sweet sound of music. Writing poems is not really all that hard. When you write poems, you learn how to use a language well. You have to use your imagination. You have to choose the best words to describe exactly what you feel or what you see. For example, if you’re trying to describe a beautiful sunset, you might come up with “melting in the distance” or “dropping quietly against the sea”. Now you have to decide which phrase is better.

They lay eggs on only one plant: milkweed. But in Mexico, people cut down the trees that the butterflies need to rest on because they want more land for farming. In the United States and Canada, farmers use chemicals that kill milkweed. This worries Dr. Taylor a lot. Now things are improving. Mexico has begun to protect parts of its forests. The United States and Canada have encouraged farmers to use fewer chemicals. Scientists still don’t understand how the butterflies know when to fly south. If they are even a few days late, they will freeze. And how do all the great-great grandchildren find the same forest in Mexico every year? This is both puzzling and interesting for many scientists. There are many mysteries yet to be discovered by those interested in science. Would you like to study biology?",

But building a living thing is far more complex than building a house. It takes millions of years for nature to change the DNA in living things to make them fit the world they live in. This is the shape of DNA. Do you think it’s magic? How tall are you? What colour are your eyes? What size are your feet? All these things are strongly influenced by your DNA before you are born!

Lesson 36: Making Plays Is Fun T H I N K A B O U T I T Today we finished our two-week study of movies and plays. It was the best two weeks, and we learned a lot. When we began these lessons, all I knew was that movies and plays are fun to watch. Like most people, I always focused on the actors or actresses. I thought they were the most important people in the show. Now I know that this is not true. Actors are only a small part of a movie or a play. It can take hundreds of people to make a movie or put on a play. We seldom think about the people who work behind the scenes. But without them, making a movie or a play would be almost impossible. Without their hard work, we would never get to know so many great stories and stars! For the group project, some of my classmates shot short movies. They all did wonderful work.

Members of the councils are chosen by students. Student councils work to make schools better places to learn. In the council, we share our ideas, interests and concerns with teachers and others.

To work towards a peaceful life, you should always try to develop good relationships with the people around you. Be kind and help those in need. Do this not only for family and friends, but also for the people who live in your neighbourhood. People in your community might have different ways of living and thinking. This doesn’t mean that they’re wrong and you’re right. If everyone had the same ideas, the world would be a boring place. Today, in many cities, people usually lock their doors after work and don’t see their neighbours much. Social interactions are often limited to a “Hi!” on the street. However, there may be times when someone does something that upsets you. If this happens, discuss the matter in a friendly way.",

When World War II was over, an organization called the United Nations (the UN) was formed to help countries talk about their problems instead of fighting. That was in 1945. Today there are 193 member states in the UN. The headquarters of the UN is in New York City. The head of the UN, chosen by all the member states, is called the Secretary-General. The UN Security Council has fifteen members, five of which are permanent members — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. Many times since 1945, the UN has sent armies to keep peace between two fighting countries.

You can ask him or her to have a meeting with you and listen to what each of you has to say. The main thing is for the two of you to get together and talk things over.

Sayings are an important part of the language and culture of every society. Although sayings are usually simple and easy to remember, they are full of deep meaning. They come from the experience of generations of people, and from different walks of life. Take a look at these sayings: Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Well begun is half done. Don’t be penny wise and pound foolish. Actions speak louder than words. Many hands make light work.

I have lived in Canada for twenty-three years. In Canada, I call myself Joe Wu. Joe is an English name that sounds like Zhou. Though I have lived here for a long time, I still don’t feel Canadian. This is probably because North American manners and Chinese manners are so different. In China, being modest is a virtue. If someone praises you and says that your English is excellent, you should be modest and say, “No, no. My English is still poor.” But in North America, this is usually a sign of being weak and not confident. You should just say, “Thank you.” I have many good friends in Canada, though Canadian culture is different from Chinese culture. In Canada, people only ask children about their age. It’s not polite to ask an adult’s age. They think it is private. But this is common in many places",

In Canada, however, people often share the cost of a meal. In China, if your guests have no food on their plates, it’s polite to put food on their plates. In Canada, you pass food to guests, but you don’t usually put food on their plates. In China, people seldom give extra money to waiters, waitresses, taxi drivers or hotel workers.

Canada welcomes cultural differences in the people who live there. So what is a Canadian? That’s a little hard to describe. Canada does not have one culture — it has many. It is important that people from different cultures can live together in one country. Is there a Canadian food? Not really. Is there a Canadian religion? No. Is there a Canadian kind of music?

Tidy up your house before your guest arrives. Open the door for your guest and hang up his coat. It will make him feel welcome. Offer your guest something to drink or eat like tea, fruit and snacks. Don’t ask your guest to go to the kitchen and serve himself! Serve your guest at the table. Make him feel at home. Talk to your guest. That’s why you invited him. Don’t turn on the television.

My Australian pen pal, Bruce, and his father, came to visit me the day before yesterday. Last night, my parents invited them to our home for dinner. At the end of the meal, Mr. Bradshaw opened a box of cookies he had brought from home. He then passed the box to everyone. We each took a cookie and ate it. The cookie tasted like chalk to me! But in good Chinese tradition, I told Mr. Bradshaw that I enjoyed it. At the airport today, Mr. Bradshaw gave me a big box of the same cookies as a gift. I don’t know what we’ll do with them.

And in some places, only their right hand? • In Russia, it’s polite to leave a bit of food on your plate to show the host that there was plenty to eat. But in India, finishing the food on your plate is considered polite. It means you enjoyed the food. Throughout the world, you will find many different table manners and customs.

One simple way to show you are a good listener is to make eye contact. ● Be honest. Tell people the truth. No one wants to waste time talking to someone who is not honest. ● Keep your promises. Try not to be late. If you set a time to meet your friends, do your best to be on time. If you have to change your plan or cancel it, let your friends know ahead of time. People will trust those who always keep their promises.",

But they were even worse than he imagined. Every lunch hour, after arriving at his new school, Sam sat alone in the dining hall. He looked at all the different groups of students around him. But he had no way to let them know that he was a good person. He simply couldn’ t find the right words to reach them. Sam knew he had to find a way to change the situation.

Instead, she decides to talk to him and find out what the problem is. She says, “Everyone is working hard on our project. But so far, you have done nothing.

T H I N K A B O U T I T Dear Diary, This week I had an embarrassing moment at a bookstore. I ran into an old friend named Gao Yuan. When he tapped me on the shoulder and said my name, I couldn’t figure out who he was. He seemed familiar but I forgot his name. I felt awful. We chatted for a while. Finally I had to admit that I couldn’t remember his name. Before I could say sorry, he said he had to go and waved goodbye. I felt bad, so I talked with Wang Mei about it. She said that she once had a similar experience. She forgot an old friend’s name when that friend returned to China after many years abroad. Wang Mei was a little embarrassed, too, but her friend didn’t mind. She just reminded Wang Mei of her name and they had a good, long chat. After talking to Wang Mei, I felt better. I",
