It is one of my early works. The story is sad but romantic. The 20th Century Fox has filmed it in a modern way. I think Leonardo DiCaprio is a suitable Romeo for modern audience. ( laugh ) Among my later works, I like King Lear best. I believe the storm scene and Cordelia’s death scene are two of my most inspired pieces. A Japanese film producer has also adapted it into a film. Then, The Tempest has its good points too. It’s my farewell to the stage, you know. Interviewer: Thank you, Mr Shakespeare.

Then read the passage, ask your partner some questions about the passage and ﬁ nd the answers together. Late that afternoon, Lurvy went to Mr Zuckerman. “I think there’s something wrong with that pig of yours. He hasn’t touched his food.” “Give him two spoonfuls of medicine,” said Mr Zuckerman. Wilbur couldn’t believe what was happening to him when Lurvy caught him and forced the medicine down his throat. This was certainly the worst day of his life. Darkness settled over everything. Soon there were only shadows and noises of the sheep chewing. You can imagine Wilbur’s surprise when, out of the darkness, came a small voice.

Wilbur feels lonely in the barn. He has asked the goose to come and play, but the goose is sitting on her eggs. Of course she doesn’t play when there are eggs to hatch. He has tried one of the lambs, but the lamb, in the ﬁ rst place, is not old enough to jump over the fence, and in the second place, she is not interested in pigs! He has asked Templeton. “Play?

Then read the passage and answer the questions. In 1440, Henry VI founded Eton College to provide free education for 70 poor scholars. They would then go on with their study at King’s College, Cambridge. Life in the early days was harsh — rats ran free and the boys had to wash outside using only cold water. Since then, the school has become one of the most elite in the United Kingdom. Nineteen former British Prime Ministers were educated in Eton, includ- ing the Duke of Wellington. The school uniform has always been a black tail- coat and waistcoat, and pin-striped trousers since the 1850s.

The spy 007 has been working for the British Secret Service since 1953 when Ian Fleming ﬁ rst wrote about him in Casino Royale . Fleming is now dead, but the spy still lives on. The ﬁ rst ﬁ lm was Dr No in 1962 and since then he has appeared in over twenty ﬁ lms. The Cold War has ﬁ nished and Bond’s enemies are not the Russians any more, but there are a lot of villains out there!

We worked for days to prepare for the hol- iday. Mother and the girls cleaned every part of the house, and they got all the extra rooms ready for the relatives. Then they washed all our best clothes — we called these dresses and suits our “Sunday best.” The men cut extra wood for all the cooking, for we had an old wood-burning stove.

The best way to play defense is by staying between the person you are guarding and the basket. Once you stop dribbling the ball, you have to pass it or shoot it. If you start dribbling again, it is called a double dribble. If you move more than one of your feet while holding the ball, it is called traveling. When you do either of these, the other team gets the ball. When you play defense, you can steal the ball from the player who is dribbling. Make sure you don’t trip or push the other players.

Greek artists strove to capture the athletes’ grace and power in works of sculpture. This famous statue is a Roman copy of a Greek statue called The Discus-thrower, made about 450 BC. The ancient Greeks used a bronze plate for their discus. 2. Many of the country’s top football clubs now have ladies teams. England’s Ladies are one of Europe’s top teams, growing stronger every season as the female game gets a real foothold in this country. Young girls can start to play with local club sides around the country. At ﬁ rst they are able to compete in the same sides as boys, but as they get older they have to ﬁ nd girl-only sides. An increasing number of local clubs are now trying to set up their own girl-only teams because of growing demand. n o 1 Look at the table and ﬁ nd the suitable verb for each sport. 8 8 Game Zone Game Zone go",

A complete American breakfast begins with fruit or fruit juice (usu- ally orange juice). The main course generally consists of cereal or eggs. For adults, coffee is the usual breakfast drink. Other popular breakfast dishes are wafﬂ es, French toast and pancakes, and all of them are served with butter and maple syrup. Lunch hour is from noon until one o’clock or so. Many people bring lunch with them from home. For this purpose they need a small, portable meal. So the sandwich is their best choice. In addition, it is inexpensive and easy to prepare.

Francisco, Paris, France I’m going to be 30 next Friday. In France, when you have a birthday, you often invite people out. I know that in some countries it’s the opposite — people take you out. Teresa, Madrid, Spain My twenty-first birthday was in April. I was really happy to go out and celebrate with my friends. They pulled my ear 21 times, once for each year. It’s an old custom. Some people do it only once, but my friends are very tradi- tional! Sometimes it’s wonderful to follow the custom. I even want them to do that on my sixtieth birthday. 107 Personal Celebrations",

In the United States, weddings are celebrated differently. But most young couples prefer a traditional wedding. Before they are married, a man and a woman become engaged. They then send wedding invitations to their neighbours, their close friends and their relatives. When everything is ready, there is the wedding ceremony. The wedding ceremony itself usually lasts between 20 and 40 minutes. The family and friends of the bride and the groom sit on different sides of the church. The wedding party goes in while the wedding march is played. The groom enters the church from a side door. The bride, with a bouquet, wears a white gown. She enters last with her father and he will “give her away”. The bride and groom exchange vows and rings during the ceremony. After the ceremony there is often a party,",

Make a compass Why: If you are lost, you can use a compass to ﬁ nd which direction you need to go! What you need: a bowl of water, a large leaf, a piece of a paper clip. How: Rub a paper clip very fast in your hair 10-20 times. Place the leaf in the middle of a bowl of water, making sure it does not touch the sides. Balance the paper clip in the center of the leaf.

Choose the words from the box to ﬁ ll in the blanks. Each year about 5 million people die because they are short of water sup- plies and sanitation. Only about 3 percent of the world’s water is fresh and most of that is in the polar icecaps. The rest appears very unevenly. The Great Lakes of North America alone hold 18% of the world’s fresh water. Water use is also uneven – a person in the USA uses over 300 litres of water per day on av- erage, and a person in Madagascar uses less than 6 litres per day. The quality of water is important to people because polluted water causes diseases. However, at present, one in ﬁ ve people in the world has no satisfactory water supply and almost half lack clean water. ﬁ v e c l e a n p o l a r e n o u g h f r e s h d i s e a s e s About",

We can recycle the glass and plastic and make raw materials. We can use the raw materials again and make new bottles. What do you think of recycling? In 1 700, a Frenchman Henri Misson visited Britain. He asked villagers why they nail horseshoes on their doors. They said that it was to keep witches away. Horseshoes are made of iron and they thought the strength of the iron could protect them from evil. Even today people think it can bring good luck.",
