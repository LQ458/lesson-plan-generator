Families in those days were\nquite big. Often, there were four or five children in one family, and they all had\nto sleep in houses of just two rooms. Sometimes, a whole street had to share one\noutside toilet. Can you imagine that?\nMost of the big cities were dirty and unhealthy. The pollution from factories filled\nthe air. People put their rubbish outside in the streets. As a result, there were many\nillnesses.\nAnd life was harder for children in those times.

You may find it difficult to use chopsticks if you haven’t\ntried before. It’s a good idea to get some practice beforehand. When the food is\nserved, you should wait until you’re invited to eat. The plates will be placed in\nthe middle of the table for everyone to share. Take a little of everything and then\nhave some more of the things you like.\nPreparation of a big meal takes a long time and everything will look beautiful,\nso it’s a good topic of conversation. You’d better join in the conversation and say\nhow much you like it.\nAt the end of the meal, you will usually be served with fruit.\nI hope this is helpful. Email me if you have any other questions.\nYours,\nZhang Dawei\n\n54",

Many people have seen the ﬁlm. 如果要表达单个数量只能换用其他单词，例如： “一名 警察 ”是 a policeman/policewoman，“一个 人 ”可以 是 a person, a man, a\nwoman 等。不过要注意，people 作“民族，种族”解时，是可数名词，复数形式是\npeoples。 3. 名词的所有格名词的所有格一般采用名词后加 ’s 的形式，如 a child’s dream, someone’s bag；以 -s\n结尾的复数名词的所有格直接加 ’ 即可，如 the boys’ schoolbags。所有格表示的是所属关系，采用 ’s 结构的多为有生命的名词。如果是无生命的名词，多采用“of + 名词”\n的方式表达。例如： the window of the house 房子的窗户\nthe end of the year 年末\nthe gate of our school 我们学校的大门注意，a friend of my father’s 与 my father’s friend 的含义不同，前者含有“我父亲有不止一个朋友”的意思，而后者没有这一含义。 4. 名词的句法功能名词的句法功能指名词可以充当的句子成分，常见的有： (1) 主语\nThe flight takes about thirteen hours. 航程需要大约 13 个小时。 Mr Wang teaches us English. 王老师教我们英语。 (2) 宾语\nMany people were helping the old man when I passed. 我路过的时候，许多人在帮助这位老人。",

    "content": "定语从句定语从句又称形容词性从句，在九年级上册的 Module 10 与 Module 11 中，我们已经学习了 that, which, who 和 whom 引导的定语从句。在学习定语从句时，有以下两点需要注意： 1. 定语从句引导词的选择从所指来看，which 只能用于先行词为物的情况，who 和 whom 只能用于先行词为人的情况，其中 whom 用于引导词在定语从句中作宾语的情况，在口语中可用 who 代替；而 that 既可用于指人，也可用于指物。例如： Everyone that/who goes to Shenzhen says it is a modern city. 每个去深圳的人都说它是一座现代化城市。 106 This is the song which/that has been extremely popular for the last few months. 这就是那首近几个月十分流行的歌。 Mr Li is the teacher that/whom/who we like best. 李老师是我���最喜爱的老师。 2. 定语从句引导词的省略当引导词在定语从句中充当宾语成分的时候，可以被省略。例如： What are the subjects (that) they are studying this term? 他们这学期都学习哪些科目？ She is the woman (who/whom) I met yesterday. 她就是我昨天遇到的那个女人。 107 W ords and expressions\nsecondary school 中学\n\nModule 1\nflight /fla!t/ n. 航班；飞行\n\n(2)\n\nbecause of 因为；由于\n\n(2)\n\n(12)\n\nabsent /'æbs2 nt/ adj. 缺席的；不在的 (12)\nbell /bel/ n. 钟；铃\n\n(12)\n\ndirect /d!'rekt; da!'rekt/ adv. 径直地； (2)\n\n直接地\npilot /'pa!l2t/ n. 飞行员\n\n(2)\n\nsucceed /s2k'siːd/ v. 成功；做成\n\n(2)\n\nas long as 只要\n\n(2)",
