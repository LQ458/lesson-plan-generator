Later, however, he began to doubt that it was a real golden crown. “Is it made completely of gold?” he wondered. He sent it to Archimedes and asked him to find out the truth. “This problem seems difficult to solve. What should I do?” thought Archimedes. Archimedes was still thinking about this problem as he filled his bath with water. When he got into the bath, some water ran over. “That’s it!” shouted Archimedes. “I know how to solve the king’s problem!” Archimedes went straight to the palace to see the king. First, he weighed the crown and asked the king for some gold of the same weight. Next, he put two pots into two big bowls and filled both pots with water. He put the gold into one pot, and some water ran into the bowl. Then he put the crown into the other pot. This time, even more",

However, no one could find a scale large enough. “Can we cut it up?” asked another soldier. “No. I don’t want to kill it,” said Cao Cao. Just then, young Cao Chong had a wonderful idea. “I can weigh the elephant!” he said. “Let me have a try.” Cao Chong asked some soldiers to lead the elephant onto a boat. As the heavy animal walked onto it, the boat went lower into the water. Cao Chong drew a line on the side of the boat to mark how low it went. The elephant was then taken off the boat and the boat was filled with rocks until it went down again and water reached the line on the boat. Cao Chong then weighed the rocks.

Einstein often received invitations to explain his theories at different universities. On these trips, his driver Hans often said to him, “It’s a pleasure to drive a genius like you, Dr Einstein.” One evening, on their way to a university, Einstein said, “I’m so tired. I wish I could avoid giving my lecture tonight, Hans, but I don’t want to let my audience down.” “I know what to do,” said Hans. “I can give the lecture for you. You can trust me. I’ve listened to your lecture so many times that I’ve learnt it by heart. No one knows you at this university, so they won’t find out.” So, they changed places. At the university, Hans was guided to the front of the hall. Einstein took a seat, listened to Hans give his lecture without difficulty, and joined in the applause at the end.

However, there are some very useful tips to help solve this problem. First, make a list of the things you and your parents disagree about most.

She shouldn’t stay on a diet if she’s already very thin. You should try to get her to see a doctor. You should also tell her that she’s not alone—we all worry about our looks sometimes. Dear Peter, I believe you’ve learnt an important lesson—you’ll regret it if you don’t do the right thing at the right moment. Next time in the same situation, you should make up your own mind. You shouldn’t listen to your friends. It was awful of them to laugh at a sick lady. Dear Simon, Lots of people wear braces these days, so you’re not alone. If you stop paying attention to your friends, they’ll stop laughing at you. So don’t worry! I understand that it hurts sometimes, but think of the beautiful, straight teeth you’ll have in a few months’ time! Dear Julie, You should talk to your sister more. Ask her to play",

He thought that other people might be in a similar situation, so he began his own newspaper to give people advice. The newspaper proved to be quite successful, and soon many people started similar newspapers. Other newspapers also started to have advice columns. By 1740, however, most of the people giving advice were women. Today we call a person giving advice to readers in a newspaper or magazine an agony “aunt”. Who do you turn to for advice?

Doris: Since I had my medical examination. The doctor said that I needed to lose a bit of weight by avoiding fat, oil and sugar. He also stated that it’s necessary for me to have a more balanced diet. Samuel: What’s a balanced diet? Doris: A balanced diet means having different kinds of healthy food every day. Research shows that each day you should have plenty of fruit, vegetables and grain products such as noodles and bread. And, in general you should have fewer dairy products and eggs, and less meat.

A Doris has written a restaurant review. Read the review below. Excellent English food at the Country House Last Saturday night, my family and I ate at the Country House. The Country House serves traditional English food. We paid about 15 to 20 pounds a person to eat there. The food was wonderful. The fish pie reminded me of my grandma. She used to cook it for me. I also had some fish and chips, and it was fantastic. The waiters were polite, but a little slow. We were seated at 7 p.m., but we did not receive our food until 7:40 p.m. I would certainly recommend the Country House for good, traditional English food.

In the beginning, many people in Europe refused to eat tomatoes because they thought the fruit was dangerous. Tomatoes first became common in the US in the 1820s. In one story, a man named Robert Johnson ate some tomatoes in public. Everyone in the town crowded around him to watch him die. When he did not die, they realized that tomatoes were safe to eat and no longer avoided them. Do you know any other interesting stories about food? How well do you know this unit?

It was 30 yards long and 3 yards high. He painted one board and surveyed his progress, and then he sat down to have a rest. Tom began to think of the games that he wanted to play. He knew the boys who were free would soon come along and make fun of him. Just then, he had an idea. He picked up his brush and went back to work. Ben Rogers came along the road. He was singing happily and carrying an apple. “I’m going swimming,” said Ben. “Do you want to come? Oh, you have to work, don’t you? What a pity!” “Work?” said Tom. “This isn’t work. I’m enjoying myself. Does a boy get a chance to paint a fence like this every day?” Then he went on painting. Ben watched Tom in silence. He became more and more interested. After a while, he said, “Tom, will you let me do some painting?” Tom said, “No, Ben, I can’t. Aunt Polly",

Wait, I’ll give you all of it.” “That’s a deal,” said Tom. “But you must be careful.” Tom gave Ben his brush with worry on his face but joy in his heart. He sat down again and started to eat the apple. When Ben got tired, Billy Fisher was waiting. He gave Tom a kite for the chance to paint. Then Johnny Miller offered him two toy soldiers. Soon Tom had got many new toys, and the fence got three coats of paint. Aunt Polly was so pleased that she gave Tom a big apple!

The most valuable gift I have ever received was a photo album from my best friend Kevin. Kevin and I were classmates for all six years of primary school. We both liked playing football and listening to music, so we always had a lot of things to talk about. It is wonderful to have such a good friend. However, last summer, Kevin had to move to another city because of his father’s job. Then he gave me a photo album. “It has photos of the memorable events we have experienced together. I've also written some notes under each photo,” he said. I was deeply moved. I put the album beside my bed. I always look at it when I think of Kevin.

At the top of a house Sue and Johnsy had their studio. In November, Johnsy became very ill, and was lying on her bed and looking through the window at the wall of the next house. “Her only chance,” the doctor said, “is for her to want to live.” After the doctor had gone, Sue came into Johnsy’s room. Johnsy was looking out of the window and counting. “Six,” said Johnsy. “There goes another one. There are only five left now.” “Five what, dear?” “Leaves. On the ivy vine. I want to see the last one fall. Then I’ll die.” “Johnsy, dear,” said Sue, “try to sleep. I must go and ask Behrman to be my model.” Old Behrman was a painter. He was past 60 and earned a little money by being a model. Sue found Behrman and told him what Johnsy had said. Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. They looked out of the window at the",
