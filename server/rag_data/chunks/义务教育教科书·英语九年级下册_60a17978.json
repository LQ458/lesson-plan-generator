This was nearly a century before Christopher Columbus first set sail on his journey of discovery to America. His travels were so important that they are still studied today. Zheng He was born in Yunnan in 1371. He rose to become a trusted official of the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The emperor ordered Zheng He to visit and explore the lands outside China. His task was to develop relations and set up trade routes with foreign countries. In a few years, he built a great fleet of ships, the biggest in the world at that time. The ships were known as treasure ships. They were big enough to carry 25,000 people as well as very large quantities of goods. From 1405 to 1433, Zheng He went on seven trips and visited South-East Asia, the Middle East and even the east coast of Africa. It seemed that nowhere was too far for him to visit. These voyages",

At the end of each voyage, Zheng He returned with many things that were seen in China for the first time, such as a giraffe from Africa. Besides developing trade, the voyages also encouraged the exchange of cultures and technologies. They helped the development of those countries and regions. Zheng He died in 1433 during his last voyage.

Marco Polo grew up in the city of Venice, in present-day Italy. In 1271, when he was 17 years old, he set off on a journey to Asia with his father and uncle, and did not return home until 24 years later. His travels took him across Asia, along the Silk Road and throughout China. He loved Hangzhou so much that he described it as “the finest city in the world”. When Polo finally returned to Venice, there was a war and he was captured. While he was in prison, he told the stories of his travels to another man there. This man wrote the stories down in a book called The Travels of Marco Polo . Because of the interesting descriptions of Asian life in the book, Polo’s travels soon became well known in Europe.

    "content": "19 Unit 2 My name is Brad Li. I’m here today to tell you about my experience as an exchange student in the United States last year. I must admit that at first America was a big culture shock for me. Many things were strange to me: the language, the food and even the school. I stayed with a host family in a small town. My host parents, Mr and Mrs Hurst, were very kind. They organized a lot of activities for me in my spare time so that I wouldn’t miss home or feel lonely. However, to a certain degree, life in the US was hard to get used to. My main problem was with the language. I failed to understand much in the first few weeks because everyone spoke so fast. Though I soon managed to get used to it, I still had problems because they used a lot of idioms. For example, they often say they are “under the weather” when they are ill. Their everyday English is very different from what we learn in China. Another difference was the food. My host family always had bread, potatoes and",

My host family always had bread, potatoes and salad for meals. I really missed the dumplings, rice and delicious dishes from home. School was a big shock too. They do not require students to wear uniforms, so students can wear almost whatever they like. Some students have strange hairstyles as well. Some students even have pink or purple hair! Anyway, I have many great memories of that year, especially playing in the snow in winter, and playing baseball. At Halloween, I went to a party dressed as Harry Potter. At Thanksgiving, we had a big dinner with a huge turkey. It was an exciting year, and it was a valuable education for me. Now I understand more about American culture.

Education in the UK Every child in the UK must receive a full-time education until the age of 16. Parents can choose to send their children either to a state school, which is free, or to a private school, where a fee is required. The school year is generally divided into three terms. Each term ends in a holiday. The summer holiday is the longest and usually lasts from the middle of July to the beginning of September. Education has two main stages—primary school and secondary school. Primary schools are for students from the age of 5 to 11. The main subjects are Maths, English, History, Geography, Science, Art, Music and PE. Secondary schools are for students from the age of 11 to 16 or 18.

Between the ages of 16 and 18, students must choose only three or four subjects to study. At the end of the two years, they must take some important exams. If they do well, they can then go on to study at university. There are over 100 universities in the UK, and the most famous are the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge.

The greenhouse effect The atmosphere around the Earth is necessary for all living things. It is like the glass of a greenhouse, letting sunlight in and keeping heat from getting out. Without it, the Earth would be the same as the Moon—cold and lifeless. When we burn fuels such as petrol and coal, we produce a gas called carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Too much of this gas pollutes the atmosphere, and causes it to keep in too much heat. As a result of the greenhouse effect, the Earth’s temperature is increasing. This causes sea level to rise, and in the future may cause cities to disappear. Cutting down forests Every year, we destroy nature by cutting down huge areas of forests. This makes the greenhouse effect worse because trees take in CO 2 and produce oxygen. Cutting down trees also destroys the homes of the animals that live in our",

Cutting down trees also destroys the homes of the animals that live in our forests, and causes the surface of the soil to be easily destroyed by rain. This can result in floods and even more damage to the environment. Bad habits Many of our habits cause pollution. People often use things once and then throw them away, or leave them on the ground as litter. This creates mountains of rubbish and pollutes our land and seas. In order to protect the environment, we need to take proper action. We should be different from many consumers and become “green consumers”. This means that we should only buy and use products friendly to the environment. We should also recycle as many things as we can. We can reuse things for the same purpose as before, or we can use them for new purposes. If we just learn to live in new and different ways, we can make a",

It started to worry me. What would happen if our city was badly flooded? Would anyone remain alive? Last night, I dreamt about a great flood: It was nine o’clock in the morning. My bedroom floor was a pool of water. I looked out of the window. Water was everywhere. It covered roads, parks and small houses. Large objects, such as coaches and boats, passed by my window. They were floating in the water. I could not just stand there! I had to do something! I tried to call my dad, but the line was dead. My computer was still working, so I sent him an email. I wrote, “Dad, there’s a flood! What should we do?” He sent me an email back which said, “Kevin, my boss has given me some work. It’s important to stick with it.

My friend replied, “I have no time to think about the flood. I’m playing computer games …” I shouted, “The WATER! Look at the WATER!” But my cries fell on deaf ears. In offices and homes, people just sat and stared at their computer screens. It seemed that they did not want to leave. Computers were more important than the flood. Very soon, the water came into people’s rooms. It poured onto their desks and covered their computers. In surprise, people finally started to notice the flood, but it was too late. Then I awoke. There was no water. I was safe—for now. 30 上海教育出版社",

It rained for six days, and as much as ten centimetres of ice collected on roads, trees and power lines. On 5th January, the people of Montreal woke up to find they had no electricity in their homes. It was dark and cold. The roads were covered in ice, so it was very dangerous to walk or drive anywhere. Families had to stay inside and burn wood to keep warm. They expected the power to come back on at any time. However, the ice kept falling. It caused branches and whole trees to fall down. More power lines fell down, and the roads became even more dangerous. By the third day, many families had no food to eat. It was a difficult time. The army sent over 14,000 soldiers to help. Finally, after six days, the ice storm stopped, but the trouble was not over. The huge amount of ice made the whole",

Therefore, a typhoon that hit several different countries might have different names. In 2000, 14 countries and regions in the Pacific Region began to use a new system for naming typhoons. Each of the countries and regions offered ten names. These could be names of men, women, flowers, animals, trees or even food items. Whenever a new typhoon arises, it is given the next name on the list. When the end of the list is reached, the same names are used over again. Do you know the names of any famous typhoons?

My dream was to see some real snow, so during the Christmas holiday, we took our passports and flew over the Pacific to Calgary, Canada. We took a bus to a ski resort in the Canadian Rockies. As the bus climbed through the mountains, we saw the thick snow on the trees. I was dying to get out and play with it! At last, we reached the resort and quickly jumped out of the bus. This was our first experience with snow. We were like little children—we made snowballs, and threw them at one another! Then we checked in at the hotel. We could see the ski slope opposite the hotel. We could not wait to get out and ski. The next day, we put on our ski suits and gloves, took our skis and went outside onto the snow. Wearing skis for the first time made me feel strange. Suddenly I found myself unable to walk! Then we had a skiing lesson with a young couple. Our",

Then we had a skiing lesson with a young couple. Our instructor took us to a gentle slope, and showed us some basic skills. To be honest, that first lesson was not a great success. I kept on falling over, and I had to hold on to a rope to keep my balance. However, the next day, I only fell over a few times, and I managed to do a few rapid runs. I felt pleased with myself, and my instructor told me I was doing much better. Although it was very cold, I spent most of my holiday skiing. I had a wonderful time. It was all over too soon. It was a shame, but we had to leave. I wish my parents would take me back for another wonderful skiing holiday this year. 5 10 15 20 25 30 上海教育出版社",

It is a difficult process for teenagers because it has an effect on both their minds and bodies. They need to understand what is going on with their bodies, how to deal with those changes and how to start taking responsibility for themselves. A young person may begin puberty at 8, while another may not start puberty until 14 or 15. In general, girls start puberty two years before boys do.

Teenage boys at this stage often begin to take unnecessary risks. Their focus is on having fun and being accepted by others. They need to think before they act and make good decisions for themselves.

Teenage girls sometimes lose confidence in themselves. They are no longer certain about their own feelings. Yet they are usually afraid to tell their parents or teachers about their problems. For this reason, teenage girls should be encouraged to discuss things with trusted adults. Parents, schools and communities can do a lot to care for and help young people. It is everyone’s responsibility to make sure that young people grow into healthy adults. More practice A Read the article about puberty from a health magazine.
