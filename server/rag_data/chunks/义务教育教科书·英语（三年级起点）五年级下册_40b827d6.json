My friends can’t find me there,” he thought. So the dog walked to the forest, carrying the heavy bone in his mouth. He carried the bone down a road. 86 Then the dog saw a big lake. He looked in the water. In the water, he saw a dog. The dog had a very big bone. “That bone is bigger than mine,” thought the dog. “I want my bone and that bone, too.” He looked at the dog in the water, and the dog in the water looked at him. “Give me your bone!” he barked at the dog in the water.
