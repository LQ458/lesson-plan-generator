Reading and vocabulary How to learn English Questions and answers Send your questions to Diana, the Language Doctor. Many students ask for advice about how to improve their English. Here are three basic questions. The first question is about understanding English films and songs. Li Hao from Hubei wrote, “I like watching English films and listening to English songs, but I don ’ t understand very much. What can I do?” Watching films and listening to songs are great ways to learn English! Watch and listen several times, and guess the meaning of the new words. Each time you will learn something new. I also advise you to talk about the films or songs with your friends. The second question is about speaking.",

The second question is about speaking. Wang Fan from Jilin wrote, “Our school has a teacher from the US. I am shy and I am afraid to speak to her. What should I do?” You can say, “Hello! How are you?” “Do you like China?” These are good ways to start a conversation. And before you begin, you should smile at her! Remember this: Do not be shy. Just try. The third question is about vocabulary. Zhang Lei from Anhui wrote, “I write down new words, but I forget them quickly. How can I remember them?” Do not worry. It is natural to forget new words! I suggest you write four or five words a day on pieces of paper and place them in your room. Read the words when you see them, and try to use them. Advice from Diana Li Hao Wang Fan Zhang Lei",

Perhaps a warm current took them north. But penguins cannot live for long in the warmer waters of the north. It was time to save the penguins. Sadly though, some penguins were too sick to travel, and some were dying. The scientists took the healthy birds and put them on a large aircraft. They flew to the south coast of Brazil. Many people came to watch the birds. But at first, the birds just looked at the water. Then, some of the braver ones swam about in it. It was cold! It was good! And so they began the last part of their journey. People cheered loudly as the younger penguins started swimming behind the older ones.
