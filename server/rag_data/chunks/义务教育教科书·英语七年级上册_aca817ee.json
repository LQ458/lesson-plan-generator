He doesn’t like e-mails. Sally: Hi, Harry. Which school club do you want to join this year? Harry: I’m not sure. What about you? Sally: As you know, I’m not into sports. I want to stay in the school choir but they practise twice a week. I want to have more time to relax. Harry: How about the dance group? They only practise once a week. Sally: What a great idea! Dancing is great fun and it’s good for our health, too. Why don’t you join the dance group with me? Harry: Hmm… isn’t dancing for girls only? Sally: That’s rubbish. There are many male dancers in the world. Harry: I think I’m going to join the cooking club.",

When school is over at 1:00 pm, I go to a club with my class- mates and friends from other classes. This kind of club is very common in Britain. In the club, the teacher arranges activities for us. We bake cakes, play sports or sing songs. We don’t have to study. Almost all kids go there and play until their parents come home from work. Sometimes, my parents come and take me home in our car. Sometimes, I go home by bus by myself. I often bring a friend home, or go to his place to play. I also go swimming once a week. When the weather gets warmer, I play football, too! 1. \" Listen and tick the things they do in the club. 2. Read the passage and answer the",

As it rises, it cools and turns back into water droplets. Lots of water droplets make clouds. The droplets join together and make bigger and bigger drops. The drops even- tually fall as rain. Some rain seeps into the land, but a lot finds its way back to the sea. We call this the water cycle. The water cycle involves all the wa- ter on earth.

If you ask someone “What’s the temperature today?”, in some countries people will probably tell you “It’s about seventy degrees Fahrenheit this evening.” Don’t be afraid when you hear the answer. Fahrenheit is a scale of temperature. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees and the boiling point is 212 degrees. Centigrade (also Celsius) is another temperature scale in which water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. Fahrenheit is commonly used in England, the USA and some other Western countries while in China people usually use Centigrade. 1. How to start a conversation?
