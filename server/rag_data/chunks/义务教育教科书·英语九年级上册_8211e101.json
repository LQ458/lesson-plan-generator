After China was united in 221 BC., the ﬁ rst emperor of the Qin Dynasty had the walls joined together and formed the ﬁ rst “Wan Li Chang Cheng” (ten thousand li Great Wall, li being a Chinese length unit). The walls were connected by a system of watchtowers. These were used not only to stop the enemy’s attack but also to communicate with the then capital (Xianyang) by signal (smoke by day; ﬁ re at night).

It was built more than 4,500 years ago. Besides the Great Pyramid, there are many smaller pyramids at Giza and other places in Egypt. The pyramids were huge tombs for the kings of Egypt and other very important people. They believed their bodies would be well kept in the pyra- mids. No one really knows why the pyramids were designed in this shape. Some people think the pyramids were built to point towards the sun and stars, so that the dead person’s spirit could ﬂ y to heaven like a rocket. The Great Pyramid is the biggest of all the pyramids. It is about 137 me- tres high. It is made of about 2,300,000 huge stones. Most of them are higher than a man and weigh about two and a half tons each. Some weigh as much as ﬁ fteen tons.

How did they make them all in the same shape? Scientists have stud- ied the pyramids for hundreds of years, but no one can just tell how. Inside the pyramids are rooms for dead bodies and treasures. Today, some mummies and treasures are displayed in museums in different countries.

The Great Pyramid covers an area of 13 acres and is made of about 2.3 million stone blocks. • The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were built by King Nebuchadnezzar in 562 BC for his wife, Amytis, who longed for the trees and fragrant plants of her home land. The gardens were destroyed by several earthquakes after the 2nd century. • The Temple of Artemis was begun in around 550 BC at Ephesus (now a site in Turkey) for the Greek goddess Artemis and was completed 220 years later. The temple was 425 feet long and 220 feet wide with 127 marble columns, each 60 feet tall.

Some of them will stay in a dormitory, some will rent a room, and others, especially students, may choose a homestay programme. The host family provides the student with room and board. They are also responsible for the student’s transportation to and from school. Host families are usually generous people. They enjoy learning about other cultures and appreciate what hosting gives to their family life. Very often host families include the students on trips to supermarkets, to square dances, or to churches. Many have long conversations with the students about education, politics, food, dating practices, philosophy, and lifestyles. Host family children enjoy playing with them as their “adopted” brothers or sisters. 7 7 8 Game Zone Culture Corner Culture Corner Homestay b rothers or sisters. 48 Unit 3",

She is such a lovely woman that we all like to be friends with her. A: You’ve known each other for many years, haven’t you? B: Yeah, we met when I was working for her dad. He had a clothing retail busi- ness. We’ve known each other for about 15 years. A: Oh, really? Do you have a lot in common? B: Well, actually, we don’t have a lot in common. She doesn’t work. She’s a full- time mum. She’s got a little boy. A: Oh. How old is he?

Try to spend time with your friend in a special, meaningful, interest- ing way. Friendship also means responsibility. If you are a true friend, you will always make yourself available, especially during your friend’s hard- est, most dif ﬁ cult times. B. Don’t give up a friend easily. Limit your interaction when your friend is angry. Don’t try to ﬁ ght back in words. Most angry people want an audi- ence. You should talk with him when he calms down. Perhaps there are some problems in his family that make him angry. C. Accepting the blame is the only answer! Admit the fact that you were wrong and apologize for it. Beg his pardon.",

In these cultures friendships develop slowly, since they are built to last. Americans are living in a society of great change. Studies show that one out of ﬁ ve American families moves every year. Americans have school friends, work friends, sports friends and neighbourhood friends. These friendships are based on common interests. When the shared activity ends, the friend- ship may fade. American friendships develop quickly, and they may change just as quickly. 65 Holding Out Your Hand",

He loses his balance, falls in the river, and begins splashing and yelling for help. His wife hears him. Knowing that he can’t swim, she runs down to the bank. Why do you think she runs to the bank?” A girl raised her hand and asked, “To draw out all of his savings?” Friends are like wine; the older, the better. False friends are worse than open enemies. Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light. When you meet your friend, your face shines—you have found gold. A life without a friend is a life without the sun.

But do you know it took man millions of years to be able to think this way? In fact, one of the most dif ﬁ cult things to teach children is the concept of numbers. In ancient times, when a man wanted to tell how many animals he owned, he had no system of numbers to use. He put a stone or pebble into a bag for each animal. The more animals, the more stones or pebbles he had. It may explain why the word “calculate” comes from the Latin word “calculus” which means “stone”. Later on, man used tally marks to count.

The next step in the development of the number system was probably to use ﬁ ngers. Again we have a word that goes back to this. The word “digit” comes from the Latin word “digitus”. It means “ ﬁ nger”! And the fact that we have 10 ﬁ n- gers led to the general use of “10” in the system of numbers. The number system we use today was invented by the Hindus in India thou- sands of years ago and was brought to Europe during 8th to 11th century by Arab traders.

The geometrical interpretation of the Pythagorean theorem actually shows the relationship of the squares constructed on the sides of a right-angled triangle. Construct equilateral triangles on the three sides a, b, and c, of the right-angled triangle. Since all equilateral triangles are similar, the areas of the triangles in the ﬁ gure are pro- portional to the squares of the corresponding sides. In other words, It is interesting to note this fact: other figures placed on the sides of a right-angled triangle also have the same area relationship as long as the three ﬁ gures are similar to each other. The reason for this is: when any two ﬁ gures are similar, their areas are proportional to the squares of a corresponding dimension. When we clear fractions, we obtain Area A + Area B = Area C Thus the area of the equilateral triangle on the hypotenuse of a right- angled triangle",

He saw a frighten- ing sight. It was a very large dark cloud. This black cloud rose high into the sky. Rock and ash ﬂ ew through the air. What Pliny saw was the eruption – the explosion – of the volcano. When the volcano ﬁ rst erupted, many people were able to ﬂ ee the city and escape death. In fact, 18,000 people escaped the terrible disaster. Unfor- tunately, there was not enough time for everyone to escape. More than 2,000 people died.

Here are some easy lifestyle changes for people who want to do some- thing right now: * Walk, ride your bike, or use public transport whenever you can. Chal- lenge yourself to walk or ride your bike at least once a week. * Refuse plastic bags when shopping. Buy reusable grocery bags at stores or use a backpack. * Use both sides of paper. If junk mail or letters from friends are blank on the back, you may save them for phone messages or other notes. * Recycle every can, glass bottle, and newspaper you use. * Try to use energy saving light bulbs, because they use much less energy and last longer. * Don’t leave electronic equipment plugged in",

Why do we give human names to storms and hurricanes? We didn’t always. Two hundred years ago, many hurricanes in the Caribbean were named after the saint’s day when the storm happened. Later, storms were known by the name of the city where they came ashore. Finally, in 1953, hurricanes started getting people’s names — specifically, fe- male names. Male names were added in 1979.
