Daisy feels scared and tired. She sits under a tree to have a rest. Then Daisy hears a noise. It sounds like crying. “Who is there ? ” cries Daisy. “Me!” a tiny voice squeaks. “Don’t be afraid!” “Who are you ? Where am I ? And why are you crying ? ” asks Daisy. “I am Birdie and you are in TazLand. I am crying because I can’t fly!” “Oh, you poor little bird! Can I help you ? ” “Maybe,” says Birdie. “I want to go to see the Magical Doctor Taz. He knows magic words. He can help me fly.” “Maybe he can help me get home!” cries Daisy! “Your home is very far from here, but Dr. Taz can help you. Let’s go together to see him. You can carry me!” says Birdie. Daisy is happy. “OK! Let’s go!”",
