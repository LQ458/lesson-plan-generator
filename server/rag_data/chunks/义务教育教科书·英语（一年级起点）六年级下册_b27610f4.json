Suddenly, the sword fell into the river. “Oh no!” said everyone. “Your beautiful sword! Let’s stop the boat to find it!” “Don’t worry,” said the man. “I can wait. I can find it easily.” He made a mark on the boat with a small knife. “There! Now I know where my sword is,” he said. Soon the boat crossed the river and the man stood up. “Now I will find my sword,” he said. He looked for his sword under the mark, but it was not there. “Where is my sword?” “Stupid man!” the others laughed. “Your sword is in the river!

People never liked his music. Joe’s brother liked to dance. He danced very well. His feet were very light on the floor. Joe tried to dance like his brother, but his feet were so heavy. He made the floor shake. One Saturday afternoon, Joe went to the park with his dad. Some boys were playing basketball. Joe watched them run up and down. He wanted to play basketball with them. Joe found a ball in his house. He threw it in the air. He jumped up to catch it. It was so easy! This summer, I will go to a basketball camp with my cousin Joe. Joe is an amazing player.
