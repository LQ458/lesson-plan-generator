In 1989, 4.8 million children in the country, aged from seven to fourteen, were unable to attend school. Eighty-three per cent of them were girls. Because of this, the CCTF launched the Spring Bud Project to help them. Since then, the project has helped millions of girls return to school. It has also built a lot of schools. The very first Spring Bud class was here in Guangxi in 1989. The Spring Bud Project paid for me to attend that class. It also rented a room close to the school for me. Before the project started, I stayed at home and helped my mother with the housework. Going to school changed my life. I learnt to read and write and do many other things. Now",

    "content": "35 Unit 3 Fishing with birds Wang Damin is a fisherman. Although he is over 65, he is very fit and still enjoys working. Damin uses cormorants to catch fish. Cormorants are large black birds. They are good at catching fish because they can swim well. They can dive down and stay under the water for up to two minutes. Damin usually sets off in the late afternoon and gets the cormorants ready for work. First, he ties a piece of grass around their necks to stop them from eating big fish. Then when Damin’s boat reaches the right place in the river, he pushes them into the river. Damin uses several ways to attract fish. During the day, he jumps up and down on his boat. After dark, he hangs a light on a post at the front of the boat. The cormorants bring the fish back to the boat. The fish are then taken and thrown into a big basket by Damin. No nets are required for this type of fishing. Cormorant fishing was once practised in lots of places in South-East China, and there",

In the short cartoons, Tom is always trying to catch Jerry, but he never has any success. Almost every cartoon ends with Tom in trouble and Jerry laughing at him. The stories are full of fun and have a long history. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera both worked for MGM in the late 1930s. Their boss told them to make funny cartoons. Together they thought of the idea of a cat and a mouse. They thought it would be funny if the mouse was clever and always got the cat into trouble. The first Tom and Jerry cartoon was shown in cinemas in 1940. It was a great success. Over the next 17 years, they made many Tom and Jerry cartoons. Most of them are around seven minutes long. In total, Hanna and Barbera made 114 Tom and Jerry cartoons. The cartoons were so good that they won a number of awards. The famous cat and mouse remain popular today, as the cartoons are",

Cormorant 2 thinks Cormorant 1 is stupid, but Cormorant 3 is happy because they will not have to work today. Idea: A fisherman goes fishing with his cormorants every afternoon. One day, one of the cormorants goes under the water but does not come up for a long time. When it finally comes up, it does not have a fish. Instead, it has a gold coin in its mouth.

It has a white face with black patches around its eyes. It also has black ears, shoulders and legs. The rest of its body is white. Home Pandas live high up in the mountains of Central and Western China. They live in the bamboo forests there. Food Pandas in the wild usually eat bamboo. In zoos, their menu includes bamboo, apples and carrots. A giant panda can eat as much as 30 kilograms of bamboo a day. Behaviour Pandas like to live on their own. They need to eat a lot to stay healthy, so they spend more than 12 hours a day eating. Although they are big and heavy, it is not difficult for them to climb trees. They are strong enough to protect themselves. Life Pandas live for about 20 years in the wild, but in zoos they can live for up to 35 years. The future",

Her father’s job was to look after red-crowned cranes. Xiujuan started helping her father when she was young. She soon showed a great love for these white birds. She became good at raising them. When Xiujuan was 21, she got a job at a nature reserve in Jiangsu Province. She enjoyed taking care of the baby cranes. If a bird became sick, she took good care of it and stayed with it every day until it was strong enough to fly again. In September 1987, one of the birds went missing. The workers in the nature reserve looked everywhere, but no one could find it. Xiujuan was very worried. She looked for it day and night for two days. On the second night, while she was looking for the missing bird, she fell into a river and died. She was only 23. Later, a song was written in memory of Xiujuan. Though",

Emma and Matt give their opinions on this matter. 5 10 15 20 Keeping pet dogs is a good idea, says Emma Keeping pet dogs is a good idea. There are lots of reasons for this. First, dogs are really cute. It’s nice to hold them in our arms, and it’s wonderful to see them grow up. Second, we can learn responsibility from keeping dogs. We have to feed them, train them and play with them. According to my mum, this helps us become more responsible people. Young people can learn how to care for others by keeping dogs. A dog will love you faithfully and bring you lots of happiness for many years. So I think it’s a good idea to keep pet dogs. 25 30 35 40 Keeping pet dogs is not a good idea, says Matt It’s not a good idea to keep pet dogs. Pet dogs leave their hair on the floor, on beds and on sofas, and they need to be washed often. Dogs are noisy. Nearly all dogs bark at strangers. Some dogs bark more",

One day, a man and two little boys came to the farm. “Which dog do you want?” the man asked. “We want that one!” the boys said. They chose me! They drove me to my new home in the city. The boys promised they would look after me very carefully, and they did. They fed me, played with me and walked me every day. Then one day, they got a computer. After that, the boys played computer games all the time. They did not play with me or feed me any more. Eventually the boys’ father took me to a pet centre. He told the staff that his boys loved their computer more than me. The centre gave me lots of food and took good care of me.

They heard some voices speaking a strange language, so they hid behind some bushes and kept quiet. Then they saw an alien! It was tall, with a round head and a silver body. It was standing next to a long spaceship. The spaceship was damaged because of a crash. The children were frightened. Suddenly, another alien appeared from the bushes in front of them. It discovered them and made a terrible noise! The children ran away in fear. The next morning, Tina and Tom told their parents about the strange creatures. “They were very ugly.
