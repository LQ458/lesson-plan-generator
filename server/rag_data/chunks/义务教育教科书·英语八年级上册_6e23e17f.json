Da Vinci was born in the countryside. From an early age, he showed great intelligence and artistic ability. As he grew older, he learnt to do many different things. His paintings are very famous, and one, the Mona Lisa , is perhaps the most famous painting in the world. He also had many inventions. For example, his notebooks include some interesting drawings of flying machines. (See Art ) 5 10 15 Dinosaurs Dinosaurs lived on Earth more than 60 million years before human beings. They lived everywhere on Earth. Some dinosaurs were as small as chickens. Others were as big as ten elephants. Some could even fly. Many dinosaurs ate plants. However, some dinosaurs liked to eat meat. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for more than 150 million years. Then, suddenly, they all died out. Nobody knows why.",

Australia’s big attractions Australia is a very big country. It also has many big attractions. The Big Banana The Big Banana is in Coffs Harbour. It was made in 1964 by John Landy. Landy wanted something to make people come to his fruit shop, so he built the Big Banana. The idea worked. Many people visited his fruit shop and took pictures of the Big Banana. Soon people all over Australia began making big things. The Big Merino The Big Merino is in the city of Goulburn. Merinos are a type of sheep. They can live in dry weather. Some places in Australia are very dry, so these sheep are very important to the farmers there. Inside the Big Merino, there is a small museum about the history of wool in Australia. Visitors can also climb up to the Big Merino’s head and look at the view through its eyes. 1 When was the Big Banana built? 2",

The king promised the old man, “You can have any prize if you win the game.” The old man said, “If I win the game, I’d like one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two for the second, four for the third, and then double the amount for each of the rest of the squares.” “Is that all?” asked the king. “Wouldn’t you like gold or silver instead?” “No, just rice,” replied the old man. The king and the rice The king and the old man played the game for a long time. Finally, the old man won. So the king ordered his men to collect a bag of rice. He put one grain on the first square, two on the second, and so on.

Before the invention of written numbers, people used many different ways to count things. At first, people used their fingers, and even their toes. However, they could only count small numbers in this way. After that, they began to make small marks on sticks and bones. This helped them count bigger numbers. They used them to count things like the days of the month, the amount of food and the number of animals they had. Then people began to use tokens made from clay or small stones. This helped them count even bigger numbers. They often put the tokens on pieces of string so that they could carry them around easily. This developed into tools like the abacus. B Are there any other ways of counting? Discuss this with your classmates. Counting before numbers After that, they made _ (2) ________________________________ _. Then they used _ (3)",

Maybe you do not, but you probably use his invention every day, and you may even have it in your hand right now! Bíró (1899–1985) was the inventor of the ballpoint pen. He was born in Budapest, Hungary. In the 1930s, when he worked as a newspaper editor, he used a fountain pen almost every day. However, he had to refill it all the time. The ink also did not dry easily, and it sometimes made a mess on the paper. Bíró wanted a better pen. His brother, George, helped him develop a special ink. The ink dried easily. Then they developed a new type of pen. There was a tiny ball at the tip of the pen. The ball rolled ink onto paper as it moved. They called it the “ballpoint” pen. The ballpoint pen was a great success. Everyone loved it. Now millions of people use it all over the world every day. People will",

He asked him to make 100,000 arrows within ten days. “No problem,” Zhuge Liang said. “I’ll bring you 100,000 arrows in three days.” Zhuge Liang asked his soldiers to fill 20 large boats with many straw men. In the early morning of the third day, Zhuge Liang’s soldiers sailed the boats towards the camps of Cao Cao’s army on the other side of the river. The soldiers shouted and beat their drums loudly. When Cao Cao’s soldiers heard the sounds, they thought they were under attack. However, they could not see through the thick fog on the river. Cao Cao ordered his soldiers to shoot arrows towards the sounds of the drums and the shouting. Zhuge Liang’s boats were soon full of arrows. Zhuge Liang’s soldiers",

For example, if you want to remember how to spell the word “because”, you can use the sentence “ B ig e lephants c an a lways u nderstand s mall e lephants”. Henry, Paula and Millie write for the school newspaper. They have written the short articles below to help students improve their memory. Memory Corner Henry A great way to help you remember something is to imagine a picture of it in your mind. If you make the picture big, strange or silly, you will remember it better. For example, to remember the word “smiles”, we can imagine there is a “mile” between the first letter and the last letter. This makes it the longest word in the world. Remember: a picture is worth a thousand words. Millie You will forget something very quickly unless you understand it well. For example, you may have trouble remembering the list of steps in the",

So, how can you improve your memory? It is important to exercise your brain. For example, you can do new things and change your daily habits. If you walk a different way to school or take a different bus, you will keep your brain active. You can try to memorize something new. You can try a Maths puzzle. You can also try to learn new skills or study a foreign language. Your brain gets lots of regular exercise if you do any of these things. If you live a healthy life, your memory will work better. You must have a balanced diet. You must give your brain enough time to rest. Unless you get enough sleep every night, you will not remember things well. If you want your brain to work well, you also need to relax. If you get too worried, your brain will slow down, and your memory will become less sharp. So, to improve",

The students had to speak on a topic in English for two minutes. We spoke to the winner, Henry. “I’m so happy that I won,” he said. “I advise people to speak slowly. If they want to be good public speakers, they’d better speak clearly and confidently.” We also spoke to several other students about English Week. One of them was Amy. “I really enjoyed English Week. It gave me a chance to learn new words. In my opinion, every school should have an English Week. It’s well worth doing,” she said.
