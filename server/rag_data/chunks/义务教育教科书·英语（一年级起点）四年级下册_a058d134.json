    "content": "前言 各位同学，你们好！欢迎大家学习本套英语教材！ 2000 年，外语教学与研究出版社与麦克米伦出版（中国）有限公司依据国家《义务教育英语课程标准（实验稿）》共同组织开发了本套教材；作为我国第一套中小学“一条龙”英语教材，本套教材已出版使用十余年。 2011 年，基于新颁布的国家《义务教育英语课程标准（ 2011 年版）》，我们对教材进行了认真修订。 在修订后的小学教材中，我们为同学们保留了大家熟悉并喜爱的四个小伙伴 — 中国学生大明和玲玲、英国学生 Sam 和 Amy，还增加了其他一些人物和小动物。他们会带领大家在一系列有趣的故事、对话、游戏、活动和歌曲中学习英语。 修订后的教材每册包括10个学习模块（ Module ）、一个复习模块 （ Review Module ）、四个单词表、一个补充阅读（ Reading for Pleasure ） 版块以及一个综合运用实践项目（ Project ）。每个学习模块分两个单元 （ Unit ），一般情况下，第一单元呈现本模块所要学习的语言内容，第二单元提供若干任务型（ Task-based ）活动，包括一首歌曲、歌谣或韵句。学习模块的课文中呈现了一些语法内容，但不要求老师做理论的讲解，更不要求大家孤立地、脱离语境地掌握，只希望大家初步学会在恰当的语境中运用包含这些语法的句子。这一原则也希望老师在教学过程中以及家长在辅导孩子学习的时候注意。复习模块对前面 10 个模块所学的内容进行综合和融合性复习，使大家的语言知识和相应的语言技能得到进一步的巩固与提高。教材有四个单词表，包括：分模块按出现顺序收录的单词，按字母顺序收录的全书单词，歌曲、歌谣或韵句中出现的单词以及人名、地名。在歌曲、歌谣或韵句中出现的新词，只要求理解，不要求学会运用。补充阅读为大家选用了篇幅短小、内容丰富、形式多样的材料。教材最后设计了一个综合运用实践项目，供同学们根据兴趣自由选择使用。 本套教材同时还配有对应的网络教材，可供同学们在线学习使用。 同学们，希望大家积极尝试，大胆实践，主动学做教材中的英语活动， 努力学唱英语歌曲、歌谣和韵句。相信你们会在参与活动、完成任务的过程中体会到学习英语的乐趣，实现英语的灵活运用和自由交际。",
