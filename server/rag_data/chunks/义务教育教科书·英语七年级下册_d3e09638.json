Group Work Discuss the following questions. A house builder works as hard as a bee. To start, he draws a picture of the new house. It is a house design. Then workers dig a hole in the ground and build the bottom of the house. The bottom is called the foundation. What is on top of the foundation? A frame holds up the walls and the roofs. Behind the walls of a house there are many pipes. Some pipes carry clean and dirty water. Other pipes carry gas for the furnace or the stove. More pipes carry steam to the heater. The roof and the windows on the outside of a house protect the people and the things on the inside. When it rains or the wind blows, people can sit inside a cozy house",

Jane Goodall is one of the most well-known scientists in the world. She spends most of her time studying wild chimpanzees in Africa. It’s not easy to watch chimpanzees. They are very shy and often run away. At first, Jane watches them from far away. Later she comes nearer to these animals, and learns more about their lives. Chimps eat vegetables and fruit. They also feed on insects. They can even make tools to help them hunt insects. Mother chimpanzees give milk to their babies and give them lessons about life.

Ostriches are the largest birds; they are often 8 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their long, strong legs have no feathers, and their necks and heads are covered with a fine down. The cock ostrich’s body has beautiful black feath- ers, and his wings and tail are covered with handsome white feathers. The hens, which are slightly smaller, have grey-brown feathers. Although they cannot fly, ostriches can run as fast as 30 miles an hour. They have only two toes on each foot— a large one on which they run, and a very small one that is almost useless. On each foot there is a strong claw as well. Ostriches usually run away from danger, but if one is cornered, it will kick with its powerful legs and slash its enemy with the sharp claws. Ostriches now live only in Central Africa or on farms in South Af-",

Ostriches now live only in Central Africa or on farms in South Af- rica. They are raised for their feathers. They live in groups of a dozen or more, and often move about with a herd of zebras or antelopes. They feed on insects, small lizards and mice, and leaves and seeds. In fact, they will swallow almost anything. During the breeding season they separate into pairs, and the cock courts the hen by fluffing out his feathers, fanning her and making loud noises. Each pair makes a large bowl in the sand, and in this the hen lays a dozen or more white eggs. Each egg is nearly 8 inches long and weighs 3 pounds. The hen sits on the eggs during the day. Her brown feathers make her look much like a dried bush. So she is not at all easy to see in the brown grassland, especially when she lowers her head to the ground.

People in the West also like birds very much. They often feed them. People there leave some food in their yards for wild birds to get. Generally speaking, they have far more sense of environmental protection and animal rights. In the West, there is an association called SPCA.

You may be asked to bring a dish of food. It is com- mon to arrive ten minutes to fifteen minutes late and leave half an hour before it is scheduled to end. You should stay at least half an hour.

It is polite to talk about your work, your country, your trip to America and what you like about America, but not in detail. Do not ask Americans how old they are, how much money their house or other possessions cost or whether they are married. Questions about adults’ age and money are considered rude.
