I can’t wait! The Moon is around 380,000 kilometres from the Earth, so it’ll take us about four days to get there. There’s no gravity in spa ce, so we’ll all be able to float around in the spaceship. We’ll ha ve to tie ourselves to our beds so that we won’t float away in our s leep! Without gravity, our bodies may get weak, so we’ll have to do exercises every day. When we arrive, I’m going to walk on the Moon. I’ll have to wea r a spacesuit to help me breathe because there’s no air on the Moo n.

The rocket disappeared into the sky. Linda and Leo were very surprised. “Will it go all the way into space?” Linda asked. “Of course it won’t,” a girl from another club shouted. “Our club is better. Come and join the Solar Power Club.” “What do you do?” asked Leo. “We make wonderful machines. They only use solar power. Look!” She took a toy car from the table and then used a remote control to drive it all around the playground. “It uses power from the Sun,” said Linda. “That’s amazing!” Linda and Leo learnt about many clubs. After the fair, they felt very excited. “I want to join all the clubs,” said Linda. “Me too!” said Leo. 5 10 15 上海教育出版社",

There was hardly any space for the children to sit down. “Whose toys are these?” asked Helen. “They’re ours,” said Grandma. “We both like collecting toys.” “But remember,” said Grandpa, “we have a lot of free time!

Daniel was the first student to speak. He showed his classmates an old stamp. “My father gave me this first stamp,” said Daniel. “It has a picture of an old Chinese stone bridge on it. This made me more interested in Chinese culture. Soon I started to look for more stamps with interesting pictures.” “Now I have over 100 stamps,” said Daniel. “I learnt a lot about our country and its great culture from the stamps! Collecting stamps is really educational.” “That was a great talk. Thank you, Daniel,” said the teacher. 1 What did Daniel show his classmates? 2 What made Daniel more interested in Chinese culture? 3 What did Daniel learn from the stamps? 4 What does Daniel think of collecting stamps? What do you think of collecting? In groups, tell your classmates about your opinions. B + 上海教育出版社",
