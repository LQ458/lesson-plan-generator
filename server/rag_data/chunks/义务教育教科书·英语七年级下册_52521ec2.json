The Leaning Tower of Pisa The Tower of Pisa is one of the most beautiful bell towers in Italy. It is not only beautiful, but also strange—it leans to one side. Today it is known as “the Leaning Tower of Pisa”. The building of the tower began in 1173. It took nearly 200 years to complete. In 1178, when the building got to the third floor, it started to lean. The builders tried to make the tower straight again when they built the upper floors, but failed. Over the years, the tower has continued to lean further. Experts have done a lot of studies and tried to “rescue” the tower. In 1990, it was closed to the public for safety reasons. After a lot of effort, it reopened in 2001. Hopefully it will be safe for at least the next 300 years. 1 Why is the Tower of Pisa strange? 2 How many years did it take to build the tower? 3 When did the tower start to lean? 4",

A friendly dolphin Last month, I went to swim in the sea. I swam really far, past the rocks and out to sea. Then I saw something moving towards me. It was huge and grey, with a large fin. It was a shark! I began to swim back, but the beach was too far away. The shark started to swim around me. I was really scared. Suddenly another creature appeared next to me in the water. It was a dolphin! It pushed me away from the shark. I sat on its back as it swam towards the beach. Soon we were near the beach. The shark did not follow us. As soon as I stepped onto the beach, the dolphin swam away. I will always remember how this friendly animal saved my life.

Dr J ones : They help us in many ways. They keep the air cool and clean. They take in harmful gases from the air and produce oxygen for us to breathe. They’re major fighters against air pollution. R ebecca : I know trees also make our lives more convenient. Many of the things in our daily lives come from trees, for example paper and pencils. Dr J ones : You’re right, Rebecca. In fact, we get a lot more from trees. We get fruit and oil from them. Tea also comes from the leaves of trees. Look around this room. A lot of the furniture is made of wood. Trees are really important in our daily lives. R ebecca : I can’t imagine a world without trees. Dr J ones : But we cut down millions of trees every year. We should stop doing this if we don’t want a world without trees. Trees in our daily lives 5 10 15",

The tap was on. “Turn that tap off,” said an angry voice. “You’re wasting water.” Dora looked around, but there was no one there. “Who are you?” “I’m a drop of water. Do you know where I come from?” “From the tap?” asked Dora. “A few days ago, I was in a cloud,” said the drop of water. “Then I dropped into a river and ran into a reservoir. Then it was time for people to clean me.” “Clean you?” Dora asked. “Yes. I was dirty. They cleaned me and added some chemicals to me. Then I travelled through the pipes under the streets and now I’m here.” Dora asked, “So is this the end of your journey?” “No. People will make me clean again. I’ll go into a river and then into the sea again.” “Again?” “Yes. My journey starts there. Remember not to waste or pollute me. I’m valuable.” Dora turned the tap off and came out of the bathroom. 5 10 15 20 Water talks 上海教育出版社",

My lifetime hobby—studying stars by Patrick Moore Studying the stars was great fun for me. Once I learnt a little about them, I soon wanted to find out more and more. Now it is my career. I host a TV programme called The Sky at Night . I use my knowledge to tell people about the stars in a lively way.
