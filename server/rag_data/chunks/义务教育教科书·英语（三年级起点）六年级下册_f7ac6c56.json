How can I do that?” It looked around. It saw some small trees. “I can stand behind the trees. They’ll hide me.” The deer walked to the trees. But the trees were too small. They did not hide it. Then the deer saw the shadows of the small trees. The shadows were very big. “I’ll stand in the sun,” the deer thought.”Then I’ll look more frightening.” The little deer stood in the sun. It had a huge shadow.The wolf saw the huge shadow. “It must be the largest deer in the forest. It must be strong,” it thought. The wolf was frightened. It ran away quickly. 1 .
