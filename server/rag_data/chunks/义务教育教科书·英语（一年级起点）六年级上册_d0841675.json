They need a lot of food, so they spend most of their time eating. They only sleep for about four hours every night. The elephant has two long, white teeth called tusks. It is the only animal with a trunk – a special long nose. The elephant can use its trunk to pick up a big tree or a small peanut. The elephant is also the mammal with the biggest ears. They look like two big fans. Elephants live in Africa and Asia. They live together in family groups. They are very strong, very smart and of course, very, very big. 2.

Sunshine looks orange, and golden yellow is the colour of a sandy beach. Blue is the colour of the sky and the sea. In English, you “feel blue” when you are sad. Green sometimes means safety.

They both learned a lot. Marco Polo travelled to many places around China. He loved Hangzhou very much. It had a beautiful lake and many canals. It was like Marco’s home, Venice. In 1292, Marco Polo left China. When he came home to Italy, he told many stories about China. People are still reading these stories today! Answer the questions. 1.
