Alastair Banton is a teacher at a language school in the UK. He also taught English in Japan. You must really want to learn the language. It is the most important thing. You also believe in yourself.

Such rafts were often too heavy to go upstream against current. In time man discovered how to hollow out logs. He burned out the inside of the log or hollowed it out with stone axes. Later men stretched bark over a light framework of wood to make a still lighter canoe. The next big step was the development of boats and ships propelled by oars and sails. This came about the same time as the wheel. The ancient Egyptians developed a craft made of pl anks much like the ships of today.

Car insurance and a valid driver’s license, as well as car registration papers, are necessary to drive in the United States. Public transportation is available in most large cities. The subway system in each city is different. Some are very modern: they use cards as tickets and are very clean and comfortable. Other cities have older systems. They often use tokens, which look like coins. Buses are less crowded than the subway and are often a very convenient way to travel between large cities and their suburbs. But buses are often caught in huge trafﬁ c jams especially during the rush hours. Often there is a long wait between bus- es. Buses and subways in most cities run 24 hours a day.

If a stamp has an inter est- ing postmark, either leave it on its envelope or cut out the stamp and postmark together and put them in your album like that. Never remove stamps from a ﬁ rst day cover. (2) Don’t tear stamps off an envelope. Float them face up in a bowl of clean water for about 20 minutes. Try not to let water get on the face of the stamps because the ink on some stamps may run. Float stamps on coloured envelopes separately. Thus the colour won’t run or spoil the others. (3) Gently peel the paper from the stamp, not the stamp from the paper.

The Crown Jewels have been kept at the Tower for a long time. They are displayed in the Jewel House, along with crowns and jewels from royal fami- lies all over the world. The Tower of London was built 1,000 years ago. It is very big! The Tower used to be a castle, palace and a prison. We heard myths and legends about the Tower. The Tower is beside the River Thames and the pris- oners came by boat. We saw soldiers called Beefeaters in old uniforms. We saw ravens, too. In the 17th century, Charles II decided there should be at least six ravens at the Tower. There is an old idea that the Tower will fall without the ravens.

The number is used to reach the police, the fire department, or an ambu - lance. An operator asks the caller for details of the emergency. The operator then sends the appropriate help. Many of the operators are trained to give some help over the phone until the ambulance arrives. Some 911 operators can identify the address even when the caller is unable to speak. In China, if a building is on fire, dial 119. If you need the police, dial 110. You can dial 120 when an ambulance is needed. Do you know when people dial 122? 1 Presentation Look at the pictures.

Next are some of the pre-bedtime activities that could be hurting your chance at getting a good night’s sleep. 1. Exercise Exercise is a vital activity for your health, and can actually contribute to getting bet- ter-quality sleep. The problem, though, is that exercising within three hours of bed- time can raise your body temperature, and make dozing off more difﬁ cult. 2. Watch TV / Surf the Web Studies have shown that pre-slumber screen time can impede your body’s ability to fall asleep. So close that laptop and turn off that TV about an hour before bed. 3. Drink too many ﬂ uids Caffeine, of course, and alcohol both make it difﬁ cult to get a good night’s rest. You shouldn’t go to bed thirsty, however, as you’ll likely wake up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water. Balance is key here. 4. Work Whatever work or school issue it is, it",

Work Whatever work or school issue it is, it can certainly wait until morning. Getting work done stimulates your brain and can cause you unneeded stress — pretty much the opposite of what you want to feel if you’re trying to fall asleep! 5. Read interesting stories Many of us have done this: you’re reading a really interesting novel and you tell your- self, “Oh just one more page!” Suddenly, it’s 2:00 am and you have to be awake in four hours. Reading a really interesting book, essay or novel before bed will make it difﬁ cult to get to sleep. Perhaps you can remedy it by ﬁ nding the most boring thing imaginable to read! 6.

In China, when you hear people say “Your English is very good”, most probably you will say “No, not so good” and you think you’re modest. But American or British people would say “Thank you!” with a big smile. When the Chinese have friends over for dinner, the hosts often get food for the guests with chopsticks to show their hospitality.
