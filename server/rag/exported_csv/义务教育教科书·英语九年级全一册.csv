But whether or not you can do this well depends on your learning habits. 但是你能否做好取决于你的学习习惯。 1) 此句中 whether or not you can do this well 是一个从句，用作整个句子的主语。这种从句叫作“主语从句”。又如： Whether you did it right or wrong isn’t so important.

Charles Dickens and his novel A Christmas Carol 查尔斯·狄更斯和他的小说《圣诞欢歌》\n\nCharles Dickens（1812 － 1870）查尔斯·狄更斯是英国最受欢迎的作家之一。他的代表作有《圣诞欢歌》\n《双城记》\n《远大前程》\n《大卫·科波菲尔》\n《艰难时世》\n《匹克威克外传》和《奥列佛·特维斯特》\n（又译为《雾都孤儿》\n）等。这些作品是世界文学宝库中的瑰宝，时至今日仍脍炙人口。除了作家之外，狄更斯还是著名的朗诵者、编辑、主编，并且他还总是乐于为各种慈善事业奔忙。 A Christmas Carol《圣诞欢歌》创作于 1843 年，是狄更斯以圣诞题材创作的一部著名小说。作品讲述了一个名叫斯克鲁奇（Scrooge）的商人，他为人吝啬、待人刻薄。三个幽灵在圣诞前夜登门造访了他，让他看到了自己的过去、现在和未来。翌日，斯克鲁奇洗心革面，痛改前非，转变成为一个慷慨大方、富有爱心的人。这部作品奠定了现代圣诞节的寓意和内涵，同时也告诫人们要拥有一颗善良、仁慈、怜悯、包容之心。善良仁慈、乐善好施才是幸福的源泉。 狄更斯这部作品对英语世界的影响深远，当代英语语汇中 Scrooge（或 scrooge）已成为一个普通名词，意为“吝啬鬼”。这一语义就是源自《圣诞欢歌》中斯克鲁奇这一人物形象。 3.
